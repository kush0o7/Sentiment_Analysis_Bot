# Sentiment Analysis Bot

This project builds a **news-driven trading strategy**:

* Collects market-related headlines from multiple **free RSS feeds** (Yahoo Finance, Google News, CNBC, Motley Fool, Investing.com, etc.).
* Uses **TextBlob** to score the sentiment of each headline.
* Aggregates sentiment by day and smooths it to reduce noise.
* Aligns the sentiment series with stock-market trading days and generates **Buy / Sell / Hold** signals based on configurable thresholds.
* Backtests the signals against free historical price data (Yahoo Finance / Stooq fallback) and plots the resulting equity curve.

Everything runs with **free data sources**â€”no paid API keys required.
